I also have advantage scholarship. I also studied social work while I was back in Nepal.I completed my highschool from Capital College and Research Center. It is located at koteshwor, Kathmandu. I did my bachelor from Triton International College which is located at Subidhanagar, Tinkune. I didnt complete it as I came to US in student visa. I also like to study about photography. I am hoping if I will be available to take photography classes in a near future. In my family I am the first one who is studying abroad. In my free time I also like to study some adventure novel and fashion magazine. My favourite novel writer is Paulo Coelho. I have read all his novel. Among all his novel I like "The Alchemist". Its a fun book with full of adventure.
